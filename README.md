# Valve Handle Labels
This project contains 3D Models, and pre-sliced files for valve handle inserts with labeles on them. 

These inserts are knowen to fit the handels of HYDROSEAL Kaplan Series True Union ball valves.

# 3D Models

These models were created using Fusion360 and are made avaliable in .F3d and .step formats. These models can be edited or remixed to meet your needs. To update the lables edit the text in sketch 3 or 4, and re-extrude thetext from the insert's curved face. 

# Object Files

Pre-exported OBJ files are made avaliable with "Skimmer" and "Drain" labels. These files can be sliced and printed in with the slicing application of your choice. They seem to print best with the following settings. 

```
Infill = 100%
Support = 'Touching print bed'
Orentation = text in the x-y plane
```
